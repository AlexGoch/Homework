                Our Cats

            <p id="catStory">
                We currently have four cats (with no immediate plans for more). The oldest is Baby, who is ~13 years old. Then there are the twins Walter and Eevee, who are about a year and a half old. The youngest cat is Jasper, who is barely a year. Baby was a shelter cat that Maddie got shortly after we started dating. Walter and Eevee are both barn cats from Maddie's family's farm, who we took home with us when they were 8 weeks old. Jasper was an impulsive adoption, as we had found out that a mutual friend was giving away kittens.
